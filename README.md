## Overview

**JitClaw** is a desktop app that brings OpenClaw into the JitAI ecosystem. It provides a graphical interface for OpenClaw agents, adds enterprise login and JitNode skills integration, and turns CLI-based AI orchestration into a local desktop experience without using the terminal.

Whether you're automating workflows, managing AI-powered channels, or connecting to enterprise systems through JitNode skills, JitClaw provides the interface you need to use OpenClaw effectively.

JitClaw ships with a bundled **New API** provider configuration and multi-language settings. The packaged app updates the provider base URL with releases, while each user configures the API key locally. You can also fine-tune advanced configurations via **Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode**.

## Why JitClaw

Building AI agents shouldn't require mastering the command line. JitClaw was designed with a simple philosophy: **powerful technology deserves an interface that respects your time.**

| Challenge | JitClaw Solution |
|-----------|----------------|
| Complex CLI setup | One-click installation with guided setup wizard |
| Configuration files | Visual settings with real-time validation |
| Process management | Automatic gateway lifecycle management |
| Provider endpoint drift | Bundled New API base URL with local API key setup |
| Skill/plugin installation | Built-in skill marketplace and management |

### OpenClaw Inside

JitClaw is built directly upon the official **OpenClaw** core. Instead of requiring a separate installation, we embed the runtime within the application to provide a seamless "battery-included" experience.

We are committed to maintaining strict alignment with the upstream OpenClaw project, ensuring that you always have access to the latest capabilities, stability improvements, and ecosystem compatibility provided by the official releases.

---

## Features

### 🎯 Zero Configuration Barrier
Complete the entire setup—from installation to your first AI interaction—through an intuitive graphical interface. No terminal commands, no YAML files, no environment variable hunting.

### 💬 Intelligent Chat Interface
Communicate with AI agents through a modern chat experience. Support for multiple conversation contexts, message history, rich content rendering with Markdown, and direct `@agent` routing in the main composer for multi-agent setups.
When you target another agent with `@agent`, JitClaw switches into that agent's own conversation context directly instead of relaying through the default agent. Agent workspaces stay separate by default, and stronger isolation depends on OpenClaw sandbox settings.
Each agent can also override its own `provider/model` runtime setting; agents without overrides continue inheriting the global default model.

### 📡 Multi-Channel Management
Configure and monitor multiple AI channels simultaneously. Each channel operates independently, allowing you to run specialized agents for different tasks.
Each channel now supports multiple accounts, per-account agent binding, and switching the channel default account directly from the Channels page.
JitClaw now also bundles Tencent's official personal WeChat channel plugin, so you can link WeChat directly from the Channels page with an in-app QR flow.

### ⏰ Cron-Based Automation
Schedule AI tasks to run automatically. Define triggers, set intervals, and let your AI agents work around the clock without manual intervention.
The Cron page now lets you configure external delivery directly in the task form with separate sender-account and recipient-target selectors. For supported channels, recipient targets are discovered automatically from channel directories or known session history, so you no longer need to edit `jobs.json` by hand.
Known limitation: WeChat is intentionally excluded from supported cron delivery channels for now. The current `openclaw-weixin` plugin requires a live conversation `contextToken` for outbound sends, so cron-style proactive delivery is not supported by the plugin itself.

### 🧩 Extensible Skill System
Extend your AI agents with pre-built skills. Browse, install, and manage skills through the integrated skill panel—no package managers required.
The Skills page can display skills discovered from multiple OpenClaw sources (managed dir, workspace, and extra skill dirs), and now shows each skill's actual location so you can open the real folder directly.

### 🔐 Secure New API Integration
JitClaw uses a fixed **New API** provider. Your system access token is stored securely in the system keychain, while model-call API keys are fetched automatically when needed. The bundled config controls the base URL and discovery endpoints, and the **Usage** page shows remote billing, recent API call details, current balance, and an in-app top-up flow for EPay.

### 🌙 Adaptive Theming
Light mode, dark mode, or system-synchronized themes. JitClaw adapts to your preferences automatically.

### 🚀 Startup Launch Control
In **Settings → General**, you can enable **Launch at system startup** so JitClaw starts automatically after login.

---

## Getting Started

### System Requirements

- **Operating System**: macOS 11+, Windows 10+, or Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+)
- **Memory**: 4GB RAM minimum (8GB recommended)
- **Storage**: 1GB available disk space

### Installation

#### Pre-built Releases (Recommended)

Pre-built installers are distributed through the project's OSS release channel instead of GitHub Releases.

#### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/zjfjiayou/JitClaw.git
cd JitClaw

# Initialize the project
pnpm run init

# Start in development mode
pnpm dev
```
### First Launch

When you launch JitClaw for the first time, the **Setup Wizard** will guide you through:

1. **Language & Region** – Configure your preferred locale
2. **Runtime Check** – Verify the packaged OpenClaw runtime and gateway status
3. **API Key** – Enter the local API key for the bundled New API provider
4. **Skill Bundles** – Install the pre-configured skills required by the desktop app

The wizard preselects your system language when it is supported, and falls back to English otherwise.

> Note for Moonshot (Kimi): JitClaw keeps Kimi web search enabled by default.  
> When Moonshot is configured, JitClaw also syncs Kimi web search to the China endpoint (`https://api.moonshot.cn/v1`) in OpenClaw config.

### Proxy Settings

JitClaw includes built-in proxy settings for environments where Electron, the OpenClaw Gateway, or channels such as Telegram need to reach the internet through a local proxy client.

Open **Settings → Gateway → Proxy** and configure:

- **Proxy Server**: the default proxy for all requests
- **Bypass Rules**: hosts that should connect directly, separated by semicolons, commas, or new lines
- In **Developer Mode**, you can optionally override:
  - **HTTP Proxy**
  - **HTTPS Proxy**
  - **ALL_PROXY / SOCKS**

Recommended local examples:

```text
Proxy Server: http://127.0.0.1:7890
```
Notes:

- A bare `host:port` value is treated as HTTP.
- If advanced proxy fields are left empty, JitClaw falls back to `Proxy Server`.
- Saving proxy settings reapplies Electron networking immediately and restarts the Gateway automatically.
- JitClaw also syncs the proxy to OpenClaw's Telegram channel config when Telegram is enabled.
- Gateway restarts preserve an existing Telegram channel proxy if JitClaw proxy is currently disabled.
- To explicitly clear Telegram channel proxy from OpenClaw config, save proxy settings with proxy disabled.
- In **Settings → Advanced → Developer**, you can run **OpenClaw Doctor** to execute `openclaw doctor --json` and inspect the diagnostic output without leaving the app.
- On packaged Windows builds, the bundled `openclaw` CLI/TUI runs via the shipped `node.exe` entrypoint to keep terminal input behavior stable.

## Architecture

JitClaw employs a **dual-process architecture** with a unified host API layer. The renderer talks to a single client abstraction, while Electron Main owns protocol selection and process lifecycle:

```
### Design Principles

- **Process Isolation**: The AI runtime operates in a separate process, ensuring UI responsiveness even during heavy computation
- **Single Entry for Frontend Calls**: Renderer requests go through host-api/api-client; protocol details are hidden behind a stable interface
- **Main-Process Transport Ownership**: Electron Main controls WS/HTTP usage and fallback to IPC for reliability
- **Graceful Recovery**: Built-in reconnect, timeout, and backoff logic handles transient failures automatically
- **Secure Storage**: API keys and sensitive data leverage the operating system's native secure storage mechanisms
- **CORS-Safe by Design**: Local HTTP access is proxied by Main, preventing renderer-side CORS issues

### Process Model & Gateway Troubleshooting

- JitClaw is an Electron app, so **one app instance normally appears as multiple OS processes** (main/renderer/zygote/utility). This is expected.
- Single-instance protection uses Electron's lock plus a local process-file lock fallback, preventing duplicate app launch in environments where desktop IPC/session bus is unstable.
- During rolling upgrades, mixed old/new app versions can still have asymmetric protection behavior. For best reliability, upgrade all desktop clients to the same version.
- The OpenClaw Gateway listener should still be **single-owner**: only one process should listen on `127.0.0.1:18789`.
- To verify the active listener:
  - macOS/Linux: `lsof -nP -iTCP:18789 -sTCP:LISTEN`
  - Windows (PowerShell): `Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 18789 -State Listen`
- Clicking the window close button (`X`) hides JitClaw to tray; it does **not** fully quit the app. Use tray menu **Quit JitClaw** for complete shutdown.

### Available Commands

```bash
# Development
pnpm run init             # Install dependencies + download uv
pnpm dev                  # Start with hot reload

# Quality
pnpm lint                 # Run ESLint
pnpm typecheck            # TypeScript validation

# Testing
pnpm test                 # Run unit tests
pnpm run test:e2e         # Run Electron E2E smoke tests with Playwright
pnpm run test:e2e:headed  # Run Electron E2E tests with a visible window
pnpm run comms:replay     # Compute communication replay metrics
pnpm run comms:baseline   # Refresh communication baseline snapshot
pnpm run comms:compare    # Compare replay metrics against baseline thresholds

# Build & Package
pnpm run build:vite       # Build frontend only
pnpm build                # Full production build (with packaging assets)
pnpm package              # Package for current platform
pnpm package:mac          # Package for macOS
pnpm package:win          # Package for Windows
pnpm package:linux        # Package for Linux
```

Bundled `uv` binaries default to the USTC mirror in mainland China and fall back to GitHub releases if needed. Set `CLAWX_UV_DOWNLOAD_BASE_URL=https://your-oss.example.com/uv/{version}` to override the mirror.

On headless Linux, run Electron tests under a display server such as `xvfb-run -a pnpm run test:e2e`.

### Communication Regression Checks

When a PR changes communication paths (gateway events, chat runtime send/receive flow, channel delivery, or transport fallback), run:

```bash
pnpm run comms:replay
pnpm run comms:compare
```

`comms-regression` in CI enforces required scenarios and threshold checks.

### Electron E2E Tests

The Playwright Electron suite launches the packaged renderer and main process
from `dist/` and `dist-electron/`, so it does not require manually running
`pnpm dev` first.

`pnpm run test:e2e` automatically:

- builds the renderer and Electron bundles with `pnpm run build:vite`
- starts Electron in an isolated E2E mode with a temporary `HOME`
- uses a temporary JitClaw `userData` directory
- skips heavy startup side effects such as gateway auto-start, bundled skill
  installation, tray creation, and CLI auto-install

The first two baseline specs cover:

- first-launch setup wizard visibility on a fresh profile
- skipping setup and navigating to the Models page inside the Electron app

Add future Electron flows under `tests/e2e/` and reuse the shared fixture in
`tests/e2e/fixtures/electron.ts`.
